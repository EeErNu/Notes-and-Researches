**Testing** - the process consisting of all life cycle, both static and dynamic, concerned with planning, preparation and evaluation of software products and related work products to determine that they satisfy specified requirements to demonstrate that they are fit for purpose and to detect defects.
  1. **Static testing** - testing of components/system at specification or implementation level without execution of that software(review and analysis of a code).
  2. **Dynamic testing** - testing that involves the execution of the software of component or system.
