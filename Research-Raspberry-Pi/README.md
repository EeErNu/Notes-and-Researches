# Raspberry Pi

Installation: `npm install`

## Introduction

Recently, I have bought a new Raspberry Pi 3B and I am super happy about it.
As I know not much about Raspberry, boards, and everything that is connected to them(from a tech perspective), I would leave my researches, thoughts and ideas here.

## What is inside?

As I have lack of knowledge about hardware - I have decided to take take a close look at my Raspberry to understand a bit better how things actually work.

## Ideas

**Idea 1**: the first idea was to create an `InfoDesk` with the following output: 
  
    1. twitter feed that is sorted by hashtag;
    2. toggl info that shows how much time I worked this week;
    3. weather preditcion;
    4. music player that will play some music `only` in certain periods of daytime.
    
Progress: 

    1. twitter feed is implemented with the help of https://github.com/ttezel/twit;
    
**To be continued...**
