# AMP Summary 

## Main Concept
The main idea of AMP is to make a mobile website super lite so it can be reached from a mobile device faster, whithout loading irrelevant/useless/heavy information or data.

## How it works
Things to know before working with AMP.
1. All simple html tags must replaced with AMP analogs. Read more here(https://www.ampproject.org/docs/reference/spec#html-tags) or here(https://www.ampproject.org/docs/reference/components).
2. Some CSS tags are NOT allowed in AMP pages. Read more here(https://www.ampproject.org/docs/guides/responsive/style_pages).
3. All media elements must have width and height
4. AMP page can have only one embedded stylesheet. External stylesheets cannot be included.
5. All scripts must be asynchronos.

In order we want to have APM and non-AMP versions at the same time - we should link pages. Read more here(https://www.ampproject.org/docs/tutorials/create/prepare_for_discovery). 

Here is a part of Documentation that helps to setup Dev Environment(https://developers.google.com/web/tools/setup/), if the help is needed...

## Advantages/Disadvantages
**What is good:** <br/>
The consept and idea is great. 

**What is bad:** <br/>
1. There are many restrictions we must to follow. Performance will raise  
2. As AMP makes the website super lite in order to load it faster - the complex sripts/styles will not work. That means if the website based on heavy scripts/styles, we do not want to use AMP.

## Conclusion based on Documentation 
This tool is definitely useful if we have **one-page websites**, **information/news related websites** etc..; in other words, after reading and analyzing the documentations I can assume that the tool is not the best solutions for websites that ordering/purchasing as their main consept. More over, uning this tool for online stores might confuse the customers... To make the final conclusion two Prototypes have to be created: First one to setup a new project to see how the technology works in practice; Second one to see how difficult is it to convert an already created project into AMP standart.
